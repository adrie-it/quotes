Think Zen. 
The project belongs to no one and to everyone. When a project is opened up, there is rapid and continual improvement. 
With teams of contributors working in parallel, the results can happen far more speedily and success fully

For high school graduation in Finland, you wear a fluffy white hat with a black band. 
There's a ceremony in which they hand out diplomas, 
and when you come home all your relatives are there with lots of champagne, flowers, and cake. 
And there's also a party for the entire class at a local restaurant. 
We did all that, and I guess I had fun, but I don't remember anything special about it. 
But ask me about the specs on my 68008-chip machine and I can rattle them off with total recall.
