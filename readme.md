"It's What non-car people don't get. They see all cars as just ton-and-a-half, two-tons of wires, glass, metal and rubber.
That's all they see. 
People like you or i know, we have an unshakable belief that cars are living entities. 
You can develop a relationship with a car.
And that's justwhat non-car people don't get."
